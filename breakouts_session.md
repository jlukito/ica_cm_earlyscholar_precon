# Breakout Session

## The need for a tangible outcome

* A place to share your code 
* Mini-groups to meet on specialized topics
* Older, tenured professors should assist in hosting computational conferences at their universities
  ** UW Madison will be hosting several of these in the coming years
* A regular newspaper
* Book series

## Getting credit for computational work

* Getting credit for computational conference preceedings
* The value of attending computational social science and computer science conferences

### CCR and Journal Publications
* Mainstream journals don't always understand computational methods, but it's important to keep sending publications to them
* Computational Communication Research + Commuication Methods and Measures (two journals for computational methods)
* Code review should be an essential component of journal publications
  ** We should start a habit of pushing one another to share our code in our publications
* Sharing data may be more difficult (becuase of the proprietary nature)
  ** Would it be possible to share samples?
  ** Consider sharing your processed data
* The importance of doing work ethically
* Pitch the idea of having smaller publications at the end of CCR (similar to Pol Comm's The Forum) to introduce new datasets and/or packages, as a way of formally giving credit to programming work. Submissions could be 2-3 pages (fairly short)

## Mini-Groups
* See if a list of these could be posted on the ICA CM website

### Ideas
* Pair programming and code reviewing opportunities
* Data science + journalism Mini-Group (DS both in journalism and to analyze journalism)
* Simulations Mini-Group
* NLP Mini-Group
* Network Analysis Mini-Group
* Computational Methods + Experiments Mini-Group
* Monthly "challenges" (similar to tidytuesdays, but language-neutral) focusing on different communication datasets
* Sharing and/or peer-review network 

### Important Considerations
* Again, these mini-groups should think about regularly scheduled events and opportunities for tangible outcomes (e.g., a conference, a publication together, etc.)
* Groups should be maintained through email lists
* Possibility of using slack as an alternative form of communication
* Some mini-groups may want more formal organizing tools, such as a shared git repo or Google Drive/Box/Dropbox folder.
